# Getting started with PHP
In these exercises we assume that you have some programming knowledge in other languages. The intention is not to teach you to program, but instead for you to gain practice using PHP.  Before you start the exercises create a new folder on your u drive called phpexercises.  Save the PHP scripts that you create during this and future workshops on PHP into this folder. Remember that you need to save them with a .php extension. 

## Exercise 1: Displaying output 
Enter the following code using an appropriate editor like Visual Studio Code or Notepad++

```php
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd"> 
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
   <head>
      <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" />
      <title>PHP Exercises</title>
   </head>
   <body>
      <p> 
         <?php  
            echo "Hello World!\n";  
            ?> 
      </p>
   </body>
</html>
```

Notice how we add blocks of PHP code inside the <?php and ?> tags and how they can be placed among XHTML tags as required. 

View the source of the page in the web browser. What do you notice about it? Notice how the result of interpreting the PHP block has been added into the html at the point at which the PHP block was situated 


## Exercise 2: XHTML validation 

 
Remember that all web pages (whether .html files or ones with output generated by PHP) must use an XHTML 1 strict doctype and a utf-8 charset. In addition, all of the html syntax of the page must be checked using the w3 validator and must pass without errors or warnings.  

Add the following code to the body of the script you created in task 1.   

```php
     <div id = "validatorLink"> 

            <a href="http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=referer"> 
           
            <img src="http://www.w3.org/Icons/valid-xhtml10" alt="Valid XHTML 1.0!" height="31" width="88" /></a> 

    </div> 
```
 

The code adds the w3 graphic that links to the W3 validator to allow for easy verification of the pages' valid status.   

 

Click the graphic to check the page generated by the script. If it is not valid, modify it until it is  


From now on add this code to every script that you create and use it to check the html. 



## Exercise 3: Variables, numbers and strings 
Create a new PHP script (remembering to use the basic XHTML core tags such as DOCTYPE etc as a basis – the DOCTYPE should be strict) and add at an appropriate place a PHP block that contains the PHP below: 

 
```php
$a=2; 

$b=4; 

$c=20 + 30 * $a + 25 * $b;  
```


Now add a new line of PHP that will output to the web browser the value of the variable $c 

 
Modify your PHP code to format the output a little better by using some text and XHTML so that it looks like the following.
###### The value of $c is: 180 


## Exercise 4: Selections and iterations 

In this exercise we will variables, a selection (an IF statement) and an iteration (a WHILE loop or a FOR loop). 


### Selections 

###### The general format of an IF statement:  
```php
    if (expression) {
        action(s) if expression is true 
    } 
```
    
##### Example 
```php
    if ($amount == 10) { 
         echo "<em>This is 10!</em>\n"; 
    } 
```  

### Iterations 

 
##### The general format of a WHILE statement: 

```php
    while (expression) { 
        action(s) if expression is true 
    } 
```

##### Example 

 
```php
    $number = 1; 
    
    $limit = 20; 
    
    while ($number <= $limit) { 
        echo "The number is $number<br />\n"; 
        $number++; 
    } 
```
 

##### The general format of a FOR statement: 

```php
    for (initialisation expression; test expression; modification expression) { 
        action(s) if expression is true 
    } 
```
 

##### Example 

 
```php
    for ($number = 1; $number <= $limit; $number++) { 
    
         echo "The number is $number<br />\n"; 
    
    } 
```
 
## Challenge

Create a new PHP script (remembering to use the basic XHTML core tags such as DOCTYPE etc as a basis – the DOCTYPE should be strict) to output the 12 times table to the web browser, using the format 

 
1 times 12 = 12 
2 times 12 = 24 
etc 

Make it write the ‘12 times 12 = 144’ line in bold and also say “Table finished” on a new line at the end of the times table. 


## Challenge

Once the basic ‘12 times 12 = 144’ line in bold  is done, try to improve the HTML that the data is presented in a table format. (Refer sample below, cosmetics of the table is not a must at the current level).

| Number 1 | Number 2 |  Answer |
| ------ | ------ |---------|
| 1  | 12|12|
| 2  | 12|24|
| 3  | 12|36|
| 4  | 12|48|
| 5  | 12|60|


### Exercise 5: The date() function 
The date() function in PHP is used to format a time or a date. The table below shows the characters that may be used as parameters in the function, e.g.  

 
```php
echo date ("Y"); 
```
 

Note that you can also add string characters inside the double quotes to help to create the output that you want, e.g. 

 
```php
echo date ("Y, ...."); 
```
